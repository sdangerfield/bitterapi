Proof of concept for a GNAF-PID Address locator to resolve adresses between NBN, Telstra and other carriers.  Will form the basis of the Data network quoting qualification tool.

Note: requires a database with the full GNAF PID created and loaded

see the excellent gnaf-loader for info on how to set this up (with POstGIS)
